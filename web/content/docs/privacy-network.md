WizeStream’s privacy approach is based on local library storage, optional features and deliberate data sharing. It does not require a WizeStream account or include advertising, analytics or tracking SDKs. That does not make ordinary internet requests anonymous.

## Local data and Incognito

Subscriptions, playlists, supported profile data, history and settings are held locally or in a destination you choose for export. Incognito pauses supported activity recording, including relevant playback, search and learning records.

Incognito is not a VPN. Your media service, proxy, receiver or network provider can still receive ordinary connection information while you use it. Clearing app storage can remove app-private data; a separate export is needed for recovery.

## Optional network features

| Feature | What leaves the device when used |
| --- | --- |
| Normal streaming | Requests to the chosen service and its media hosts, with normal connection information. |
| Update checks | Requests to the WizeStream GitHub Releases API when checks are enabled or requested. |
| SponsorBlock playback | Supported public video lookups to the selected community service. |
| SponsorBlock contributions | The public submission/vote and a private persistent contribution ID, after explicit opt-in. |
| DeArrow | Public video identifiers for accepted replacement titles/thumbnail frames when enabled. |
| Live Radio / Live TV | Directory requests and requests to the chosen external stream source. |
| Casting / home audio | Selected media information sent to your chosen receiver or configured server. |

An optional community provider has its own policies. Disabling a feature is different from erasing records already submitted to an external service.

## On-device comment translation

On Android 12 and newer, translation can use Android’s on-device translation framework when the required language pair is already present and ready. WizeStream does not download a translation model or provide a cloud fallback for this feature.

Language detection uses Android text-classification services, which can be supplied by the OS or device manufacturer in a local process. A missing Translate action can reflect language detection, matching languages or an unavailable ready language pair rather than a missing Google login.

## Proxy connections

Open **Settings → Proxy** to configure HTTP or SOCKS5 with optional authentication. Supported new remote browsing, image, playback, download, update and community-service connections use the selected proxy configuration.

Localhost, private addresses and supported local hostnames bypass it so Device Sync and casting can remain reachable. HTTPS content stays encrypted in transit, but a proxy can still see destination hosts. Credentials are protected with Android Keystore and excluded from normal backups.

A configured proxy failure does not silently fall back to a direct remote connection. Plain HTTP proxy transport can expose HTTP Basic credentials to the network between the device and proxy; choose a proxy and network you trust.

## Invidious and media-host trust

Invidious mode depends on the selected instance and the media infrastructure it uses. Saved instances and explicit per-instance trust for Companion hosts are separate from trusting every redirected URL.

**Settings → Content → Trusted Invidious media servers** accepts verified HTTPS root origins, up to sixteen per selected instance. Do not enter broad arbitrary hosts or unknown redirect destinations just to suppress an error.

Direct YouTube requests remain blocked in Invidious mode until an explicit direct-playback choice is made after a failure. Switching to direct playback changes who receives the request.

## Sync and backups

Device Sync uses encrypted peer-to-peer connections after one-time QR pairing. Search history is excluded unless enabled on both devices. Actual downloaded media files are not transferred.

Portable backups can contain personal library information even when the app uses no cloud account. Share those files intentionally and review them before sending them to anyone. Proxy credentials and private SponsorBlock contribution identity are not normal backup/sync content.

## Error reports are deliberate

WizeStream does not upload crash reports automatically. Review and edit the report before copying it, sending email or opening a GitHub issue. Reports can include public or private requested URLs, service/language details, app and Android versions, exceptions and your text.

Remove passwords, cookies, private stream links and other sensitive information from public reports. For the broader explanation and the website’s separate privacy behavior, see the [privacy overview](../privacy.html).
