WizeStream offers several ways to use the same media: a main video player, background audio, Listen mode, a floating popup and optional Android picture-in-picture. Availability depends on the source stream, Android version and enabled settings.

## Choose a playback mode

| Mode | What it does | When to use it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Main player | Video playback with details, captions and queue controls | Watching normally on your phone or tablet. |
| Listen | Continues the current item as audio with a visualizer | Listening without losing your queue or position. |
| Background | Audio playback while the app is not in the foreground | Music, interviews and long recordings. |
| Popup | Floating WizeStream video window | Watching alongside another app. |
| Android PiP | System-managed picture-in-picture on Android 8+ | A native floating window with media controls. |

Popup playback may need Android’s permission to display over other apps. Native PiP has its own Android permission and setting. The popup remains the floating-player path for Android 6 and 7.

## Queue, quality and audio tracks

Use the queue to arrange several items, add something next or later, and change the order before it plays. Repeat and shuffle apply to the queue rather than creating a remote platform playlist.

Quality and format choices depend on what the service exposes. Configure main/popup defaults and mobile-data limits in Video and audio settings. Multi-audio videos can offer different languages or tracks; select among the tracks actually provided by that stream.

Chapter markers help you move between sections. Supported captions can be selected by language; the transcript view provides a searchable alternative to reading captions in real time. Per-channel playback profiles can preserve selected playback preferences for individual channels.

## Gestures and fullscreen

Pinch with two fingers to zoom from **100% to 400%** in the main player. Once enlarged, use two fingers to pan. Pinch back or use the Fit/Fill/Zoom control to reset the view. Touch lock helps avoid accidental playback gestures.

Volume, brightness and seeking gestures are configurable. A vertical two-finger gesture can adjust speed when enabled and when the video is not already zoomed. Phones, tablets and TV remotes have different control and focus paths; see [devices and casting](devices.html).

## Captions and timing

Open the caption menu to select a track. **Subtitle timing** adjusts a caption track in 100 ms steps, up to 30 seconds earlier or later. Use Reset to return to the original timing.

The offset is session-only and clears when the caption track changes. It does not rewrite a downloaded subtitle file or change the source video.

## A–B repeat

In current development builds, enable A–B repeat under **Settings → Video and audio**. Its enable switch is **off by default**. Set A at the start of the passage and B at its end; B must be at least half a second after A.

The selected passage repeats during non-live playback. Clear the range when you want normal playback again. The range is temporary, not a saved playlist or an export. The independent enable switch was added after stable 1.41.0.

## 360° video

The player supports automatic projection detection and manual equirectangular viewing. In current development builds, first enable the optional 360° setting in Video and audio; this separate switch is off by default and postdates 1.41.0.

Use **360° → Video projection** to choose Automatic, Flat or a manual projection. Drag to look around, enable optional motion tracking if desired, and use Recenter to restore the forward view. TV and keyboard panning are also supported. A flat video does not become a genuine spherical recording when forced into a 360° projection.

## Listening and audio tools

Listen mode keeps the current item and queue while displaying a chosen visualizer. **Settings → Video and audio → Visualizer style** offers 15 styles. The visualizer uses decoded player audio; it does not need microphone access.

The audio tools include a 10-band equalizer, presets and a custom curve. Loudness normalization and dynamic-range compression are optional and off by default. Leave headroom when boosting frequencies to reduce clipping.

## Live streams, timers and recovery

Full live rewind is limited by the DVR history a broadcaster supplies. A broadcast can end, change formats or stop exposing its archive. No client can guarantee unlimited rewind or continuing access to every historical segment.

The sleep timer supports presets, custom durations, end-of-video or end-of-queue behavior, with an optional fade. Queue recovery can preserve loaded queue entries for later recovery when its setting and watch history are enabled. Incognito queues are excluded; recovery is not a permanent backup.
